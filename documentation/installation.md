# DevBot setup  
For proper project installation or update, I would recommend you to run special scripts for install or update.

## Prerequisites
Before start the installation, [please be aware of prerequisites](prerequisites.md) 

## Build and install
To make your life easier, I've made a `step` in the Makefile to build the project. Just run:
```text
make build
```
Once your project was build without errors, you will be able to run the application.
