# Welcome to contributing guide
Thank you for investing your time in contributing to devbot project! 
Read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.
In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

# Getting started

## Issues
If you spot any problem related to the devbot core functionality, [search first if this issue already exists and open](https://github.com/sharovik/devbot/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

Please, describe the context and type of the problem you spoted. If you can, describe the scenario, how to reproduce the issue. If it is possible, provide the screenshots.

## Solve the issues
[Scan through our existing issues](https://github.com/sharovik/devbot/issues) to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

## Add Changes
1. Fork the repository
2. Install all dependencies, described in the [prerequisites page](documentation/prerequisites.md) and setup devbot locally
4. Create a working branch and start with your changes
5. Commit the changes

## Pull-Requests
When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.

1. Link PR to issue if you are solving one
2. Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge. Once you submit your PR, a devbot team member will review your proposal. There may be questions asked or additional information requested.
3. We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

## Your PR is merged ðŸŽ‰
Once your Pull-request gets approved, we will merge it into our repository. And you will see your changes in our repository
